TSRschools
This project is known as TSR(Tech San Ramon) in which students from Dougherty Valley teach other schools across the SRVUSD
district the basics on computer science. This is the upgraded version of the last version of the project which was used 
for only the school Coyote Creek.
Our current schools include:
- Gale Ranch Middle School
- Windemere Ranch Middle Schoool
- Coyote Creek ES
- Quail Run ES
- Possibly Bella Vista or Live Oak as well in the future.
